# L.B. Stanza Tap

[L.B. Stanza](http://lbstanza.org) is an optionally-typed, general-purpose langauge.  I've only tested the linux version so please submit issues if you have any problems with the Mac version.


### Linux
```fish
brew install MadcapJake/lbstanza/stanza-linux
```

### Mac
```fish
brew install MadcapJake/lbstanza/stanza-mac
```

### Caveats

Be sure to set the `STANZA_CONFIG` variable as shown after installing.

### Tips


[`stz`] provides a simple wrapper for executing one-liners and running scripts.

```fish
brew install fisher
fisher i stz
```
